This is a diagram for keeping and checking information about animals in a zoo.

The task is:

Designing a system to track information about animals in a zoo.

Animals:
Characterized by species in groups such as:

Horses (horses, zebras, donkeys, etc.),
Felines (tigers, lions, etc.),
Rodents (rats, beavers, etc.).
Most of the information stored about animals is the same for all groupings, such as species name, weight, age, etc.

The system should also be able to get the dosage of certain medications for each animal => getDosage().

The system should be able to calculate feeding times => getFeedSchedule().

The logic for performing these functions will be different for each grouping. For example, the feeding algorithm will be different for horses than it is for tigers.

Using the polymorphism model, design a class diagram to address the situation described above.

The UML diagram for this system:
